AIM OF THE GAME

The aim of the game is to never leave empty spaces between the pieces in order to complete the horizontal lines.

In fact, when a horizontal line of the grid is completed, therefore there are no empty spaces between the blocks, the line will be deleted and everything above will fall down by one block.

---

SCORE

Every time a line is completed and deleted, your score will be increased by 100 points. If you delete more lines together at the same time (up to four), your score will be increased by a special factor.

GAME OVER

If you stack too many pieces and you reach the top of the grid, you lose the game.
